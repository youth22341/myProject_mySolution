This prgram exist when me and my friend play Wordscapes game. To complete this game, you have to create many words from suggest characters.
For example:
   with character = "SAELF", you can have many meaning words with any length of word, such as: SALE,SAFE,LEAF,SEA,....
It look like crossing word puzzle, then you can know what type of words are missing.
When I play, it took me several times to try and error which words both meaning and have "type of missing"
The game goes hard when the level is more higher, then there are more and more suggest characters.
That why I code this program, which idea like pemutation algorithm.
My first plan is the program can show all combinations - pemutations of words can be filled in. Then I will choose the meaning words from that. To do this, I think I should use some knowledge about struct, node to distinguish all elements. Furthermore, I also want to connect to any dictionaries (offline) to filter all nonsense words.
But, sadly, I'm not success in that. My program is still not complete, my pemutation algorithm still have similar words, I do not have construction like struct, node,.. as I mentioned before.
I have used it to play the gamme in my phone: split the screen into 2 parts and use compiler in my phone to solve my problem. It works in another way.
I upload source code here and I'm very pleasure to get recommend from you to complete it. Thank you very much!
